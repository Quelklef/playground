Such precious gemstones
Morning dew shines like diamonds
God’s tears from heaven

NEXTHAIK

An old silent pond...
A frog jumps into the pond,
splash! Silence again.

NEXTHAIK

Autumn moonlight—
a worm digs silently
into the chestnut.

NEXTHAIK

Lightning flash—
what I thought were faces
are plumes of pampas grass.
